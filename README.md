Overview: 
This project presents an exploration of an autonomous car driving project, utilizing the Udacity car simulator to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network based on the VGG-16 architecture. The objective of this project was to develop a model capable of predicting the steering angles to drive around a simulated car track.
