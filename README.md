Overview: 
This project presents an exploration of an autonomous car driving project, utilizing the Udacity car simulator to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network based on the VGG-16 architecture. The objective of this project was to develop a model capable of predicting the steering angles to drive around a simulated car track. The Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator was used to train, test, and validate this model. Driving data was collected from the simulator in the form of left, right, and center front-view images to train the model on. The performance was evaluated in terms of steering accuracy and overall driving behavior. This paper discusses the methodology used to gather the training data, the process of model training, and the model's overall performance. A test set of data where the car drove backward was also assessed to view how the model works with a low-quality dataset. Additionally, challenges encountered through the training and testing phase are analyzed and explored. The overall goal of the project was to demonstrate the VGG-16 model for end-to-end autonomous driving.
